# Frontend Mentor - Skilled e-learning landing page

## The challenge

This is a challenge from [Fontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

I'll also give credit to [Coder Coder](https://youtu.be/nl9VlTA-AfE?si=Z6aEzLvKN3uztIz5). Coder Coder did a great Youtube tutorial on this which I followed but then tweaked as I went to my specification.

The challenge consisted of the following:

Build out tha landing page and get it looking as close to the design that was given as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

All the media assets were provided for this challenge but the planning of the design and what tools and frameworks I used was left to me. This was created using pure HTML and CSS only.
