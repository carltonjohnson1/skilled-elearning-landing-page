![Design preview for the Skilled e-learning landing page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge consisted of the following:

Build out tha landing page and get it looking as close to the design that was given as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

All the media assets were provided for this challenge but the planning of the design and what tools and frameworks I used was left to me. This was created using pure HTML and CSS only.
